    <h2 class="headers">Background:</h2>
        <p id="paragraph-text">My name is Noah Weaver. I am a veteran of the United States Air Force with a background in Law Enforcement, Security, Electronic Security, and Antiterrorism. I served six years and achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant. I have been a student since my separation in 2019. From January 2020 to August 2021 I was a full-time student. Due to recent life events, I have decided to get back into the work force.</p>
    <h2 class="headers">Current:</h2> 
        <p id="paragraph-text">Recently, I made the decision to attend to move into the tech field. I decided to attend <a href="https://vschool.io">VSchool</a> to become a <a href="https://vschool.io/development">Full Stack Web Developer.</a> I am beyond excited for the skills and opportunities that this bootcamp will provide to me.</p>
