Level 4 Capstone Proposal
By: Noah Weaver

	
For the level 4 capstone I am proposing a dad-joke application. This application will allow users to see a joke of the day, view a library of jokes, and search for jokes by type. The primary users for this application are new dads and anyone who enjoys a good joke. New dads can use this application to build their dad-joke arsenal until dad-joking becomes second nature. Non-dads can stop by just to get a good laugh.
